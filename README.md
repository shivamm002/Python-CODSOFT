#Python-CODSOFT

During my Python internship at CodSoft, I had the opportunity to work on practical projects that strengthened my understanding of core programming concepts, GUI development, and problem-solving using Python. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the first four tasks I completed:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Task 1: To-Do List Application
	‚Ä¢	Developed a GUI-based to-do list using Tkinter.
	‚Ä¢	Enabled users to add, update, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Helped improve organizational skills through efficient task management.

‚∏ª

üßÆ Task 2: Calculator
	‚Ä¢	Created a basic calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	‚Ä¢	Designed user input prompts and output display using Python‚Äôs simple GUI or console-based interface.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on arithmetic logic and error handling.

‚∏ª

üîê Task 3: Password Generator
	‚Ä¢	Built a program that generates random, strong passwords.
	‚Ä¢	Allowed user-defined length and complexity.
	‚Ä¢	Utilized Python‚Äôs random and string libraries to create secure passwords.

‚∏ª

‚úä Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
	‚Ä¢	Developed an interactive game with user input, randomized computer choices, and result display.
	‚Ä¢	Incorporated game logic to determine the winner.
	‚Ä¢	Added features like score tracking and play-again loop for better user experience.

‚∏ª
